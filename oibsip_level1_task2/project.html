                <h3>Project 1:-Landing Page</h3>
                <p>A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This
                    project demands a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to add columns,
                    divide sections, arrange items, add headers, footers. Most importantly, you will use your
                    creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette,
                    boxes and all the other elements on the page require attention. Use CSS carefully to make sure
                    the elements on the page do not overlap.</p>

                <h3>Project 2:- Portfolio</h3>
                <p>You can create a personal portfolio with the basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one
                    of the most common projects on web development for beginners. In a personal portfolio, you get
                    to show a wide range of samples and skills and add your resume. You can add an image at the top
                    where you can introduce yourself; below that, you can add contact information.</p>

                <h3>Project 3:- Temperature Convertor</h3>
                <p>In This Project the user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a
                    "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.

                    In this project UI should include four main elements:

                    Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input
                    is a number!

                    Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or
                    Fahrenheit

                    "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion

                    Display area for the final converted temperature and unit

                    For an extra challenge: You can add in a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin
                    as well.</p>
